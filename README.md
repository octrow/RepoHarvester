# RepoHarvester

## Overview
RepoHarvester is a Python utility designed to clone a GitHub repository and compile all non-media files into a single text file. It's particularly useful for code analysis, backups, or when you need an offline version of the repository's text-based content.

## Features
- **Selective Cloning**: Clones a GitHub repository and intelligently excludes non-essential file types (e.g., media, system files).
- **Comment Removal**: Provides an option to remove comments from code files, supporting commonly used programming languages.
- **Flexible Exclusions**: Allows customization of excluded file types using the --no-skip command-line argument.
- **Maximum File Size Control**: Implements size restrictions for included files:
- - Files larger than a specified threshold (`--max-size`) are automatically skipped.
- - Files exceeding 500KB but smaller than the maximum size are logged for awareness.
- **Single File Output**: Compiles relevant files into a unified, well-structured text file.

## Installation
1. Clone the RepoHarvester repository or download the repoharvester.py script.
2. Ensure you have Python (https://www.python.org/) and Git (https://git-scm.com/) installed.

## Usage
Run the script using the following command:

```shell
python repoharvester.py <repo_url> [-r|--remove] [--no-skip <group1> <group2> ...] [--max-size <size_in_kb>] 
```

- `repo_url` : (Required): The SSH URL of the GitHub repository to clone.
- `--remove` \ `-r` (optional): Removes comments from supported code files.
- `--no-skip` (optional): Includes specified file groups that would otherwise be excluded.
- - Available groups can be found in the "Default Excluded File Types" section.
- `--max-size` (Optional): Sets the maximum allowed file size in kilobytes (KB). Files exceeding this size are skipped. Files larger than 500KB but within the limit are logged. The default maximum size is 1000KB.

### Arguments
- `repo_url``: The SSH URL of the GitHub repository to clone.
- `-r, --remove`: Remove comments from code files office files.
- `--skip`: Skip files of certain types. You can specify multiple types separated by spaces. Available types are: media, office, system, executables, archive, audio, video, database, font, temporary, compiled_code, certificate, configuration, virtual_env, node_modules, python_bytecode, package_locks, log_files, cache_files.
### Example
This command:
- Clones the specified repository.
- Removes comments from code files.
- Includes media and office files.
- Sets the maximum allowed file size to 250KB.

```bash
python repoharvester.py git@github.com:username/repo.git --remove --no-skip media office --max-size 250
```

## Default Excluded File Types

RepoHarvester excludes many common file types by default. These include but are not limited to:

- Media files: png, jpg, jpeg, gif, bmp, tiff, svg, ico, raw, psd, ai
- Office documents: xlsx, xls, docx, pptx, pdf
- System files: pack, idx, log, DS_Store, sys, ini, bat, plist
- Executables: exe, dll, so, bin
- And many moreâ€¦

- See the EXTENSION_GROUPS dictionary within the code for the complete list.


## Comment Patterns
The comment_patterns.py file contains regular expressions used to identify and remove comments from various programming languages:

```python
COMMENT_PATTERNS = {
    'py': r'#.*',  # Python
    'js': r'//.*|/\*[\s\S]*?\*/',  # JavaScript
    ...
    # Add more patterns for different file types as needed
}

```

## Output Format
The generated text file will have the following structure:
```
## <name_of_repository>
### <filename>.<file_extension>
<content_of_the_file>
### end of file
...
```
