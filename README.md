# RepoHarvester

## Overview
RepoHarvester is a Python utility designed to clone a GitHub repository and compile all non-media files into a single text file. It's particularly useful for code analysis, backups, or when you need an offline version of the repository's text-based content.

## Features
- **Selective Cloning**: Clones the repository and excludes media files based on their extensions.
- **Comment Removal**: Offers an option to remove comments from code files, supporting multiple programming languages.
- **Flexible Exclusions**: Allows for fine-grained control over which types of files to exclude.
- **Single File Output**: Compiles all text-based files into a single, well-organized text file.

## Installation
Clone the RepoHarvester repository or download the `repoharvester.py` script. Ensure you have Python and Git installed on your system.

## Usage
Run the script using the following command:

```shell
python repoharvester.py <repo_url> [--remove] [--skip]
```
- <repo_url>: The SSH URL of the GitHub repository.
- `--remove` \ `-r` (optional): Include this flag if you want to remove comments from the code files.
- `--skip` (optional): Include this flag followed by the types of files you want to skip.

### Arguments
- `repo_url``: The SSH URL of the GitHub repository to clone.
- `-r, --remove`: Remove comments from code files office files.
- `--skip`: Skip files of certain types. You can specify multiple types separated by spaces. Available types are: media, office, system, executables, archive, audio, video, database, font, temporary, compiled_code, certificate, configuration, virtual_env, node_modules, python_bytecode, package_locks, log_files, cache_files.
### Example
This command will clone the repository at git@github.com:username/repo.git, remove comments from code files, skip media and office files, and compile the remaining files into a single file named repo_all_files.txt:
```bash
python repoharvester.py git@github.com:username/repo.git --remove --skip media office
```

## Excluded File Types
By default, RepoHarvester excludes a wide range of file types that are typically not necessary for textual analysis. This includes but is not limited to:
The script excludes the following media file extensions by default:
- Media files: png, jpg, jpeg, gif, bmp, tiff, svg, ico, raw, psd, ai
- Office documents: xlsx, xls, docx, pptx, pdf
- System files: pack, idx, log, DS_Store, sys, ini, bat, plist
- And many moreâ€¦

## Comment Patterns
The comment_patterns.py file contains regular expressions used to identify and remove comments from various programming languages:

```python
COMMENT_PATTERNS = {
    'py': r'#.*',  # Python
    'js': r'//.*|/\*[\s\S]*?\*/',  # JavaScript
    ...
    # Add more patterns for different file types as needed
}

```

## Output Format
The generated text file will have the following structure:
```
## <name_of_repository>
### <filename>.<file_extension>
<content_of_the_file>
### end of file
...
```
